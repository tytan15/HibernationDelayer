Using this program you can set delay, when hibernation should occur. Time can be set by entering hours and minutes, the rest will be automatic (calculation to seconds* and counting to zero).
The application can be run in english and polish language.
If you find the program useful or you think something should be added please leave some info.

*Using system command "shutdown /h" you can plan when to hibernate, but you must calculate hours and minutes to seconds manualy.
